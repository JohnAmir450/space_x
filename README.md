# Space_X

## Project Overview
Space_X is an innovative mobile application designed to provide users with detailed information about rockets, astronauts, and launchships. The app integrates with external APIs to fetch the latest data, ensuring users stay informed about space exploration. Additionally, it uses Firebase Authentication for user management and Firebase Storage to save user data.

## Key Features
- **Rocket Information**: Displays comprehensive details on various rockets.
- **Astronaut Profiles**: Provides in-depth information on astronauts.
- **Launchship Data**: Keeps users updated with the latest information on launchships.
- **User Authentication**: Implements Firebase Authentication for secure user registration and login.
- **User Data Management**: Utilizes Firebase Storage to effectively store and manage user data.
- **Search Functionality**: Allows users to search for specific rockets, astronauts, and launchships and retrieve relevant details.

## Technologies Used
- **Flutter**: Developed the mobile application using Flutter for cross-platform compatibility.
- **Firebase Authentication**: Ensured secure user authentication and authorization.
- **Firebase Storage**: Managed and stored user data seamlessly.
- **BLoC Pattern**: Utilized BLoC (Business Logic Component) for state management, ensuring a responsive and scalable app architecture.
- **REST API Integration**: Fetched data about rockets, astronauts, and launchships from external APIs.
